# generative_sketch
this is a place for all my generative sketch assignment 1 stuff to go

I wanted to focus on disrupting a grid. I decided to make them stretch and flow across the screen similar to water. I chose blue and purple colors so that as the mouse moves it looks like water ebbing and flowing and reflecting back at the user. I used the mouseX and mouseY values in the fill and rec functions to make the shapes move and expand wih the users movement and smoothly change colors. I also tried to make a generativ aspect and I couldn't get the bugs worked out. I cannot figure out what is wrong with the code to make it work. It should make a small white circle that moves around the screen by itself. Honestly, this doesnt fit super well with my goals for this composition but I figured it would be a simple starting point for making the drawing generative.
