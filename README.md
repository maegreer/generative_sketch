# generative_sketch
this is a place for all my generative sketch assignment 1 stuff to go

I wanted to focus on making a natural flow with inorganic shapes. I chose blue and purple colors so that as the mouse moves it looks like water ebbing and flowing and reflecting back at the user. I used the mouseX and mouseY values in the fill and rec functions to make the shapes move and expand wih the users movement and smoothly change colors.
